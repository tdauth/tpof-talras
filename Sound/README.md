# German Voice Recordings

The voice recordings are distributed separately since they depend on the language and would increase the map size, so it would be unplayable.

## How to install


### Step 1

Download and move this Sound directory into your Warcraft: Reforged folder:

* [Download this repository as ZIP file](https://github.com/tdauth/tpof-talras/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
* Extract only the Folder "Sound" into your `C:\Program Files (x86)\Warcraft III\_retail_` folder or wherever your Warcraft III installation is.

### Step 2

Enable "Allow Local Files" in the registry:

* Press Windows key + R to execute a command
* Execute RegEdit.exe
* Search for "Allow Local Files" or go directly to the entry "Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Blizzard Entertainment\Warcraft III".
* Set the value of "Allow Local Files" to 1.

### Play the Map

The sound files should work now when you start the map.
