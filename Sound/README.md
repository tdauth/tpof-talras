# German Voice Recordings

The voice recordings are distributed separately since they depend on the language and would increase the map size, so it would be unplayable.

## How to install

Enable "Allow Local Files" in the registry:

* Press Windows key + R to execute a command
* Execute RegEdit.exe
* Search for "Allow Local Files" or go directly to the entry "Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Blizzard Entertainment\Warcraft III".
* Set the value of "Allow Local Files" to 1.

Copy or move this folder into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Warcraft III\_retail_`.

The sound files should work now when you start the map.
