Multi-Shape Mushroom Item
By Jhonny Janbo

Description:
The Screenshot shows the 1 type of item model. Yes 1.

     The model of the mushroom is made to fit as items. It will randomly appears as 1 of the 4 different shapes when the item is created in game, and the model will not change until the item is destroyed.

     In the World Editor it just flash between the different shapes, so you need see the results in game.

     It is useful to break the ugly repetition of items model, mainly when there are many equal items together on the ground. Test and it will explain it self

     I am posting this just to became a template to made other items as you like.

     I don't know if this method is already familiar, in this case, plz tell me and I will remove it immediately.
