Yes 1.<br />
<br />
     The model of the mushroom is made to fit as items. It will randomly appears as 1 of the 4 different shapes when the item is created in game, and the model will not change until the item is destroyed.<br />
<br />
     In the World Editor it just flash between the different shapes, so you need see the results in game.<br />
<br />
     It is useful to break the ugly repetition of items model, mainly when there are many equal items together on the ground. Test and it will explain it self<br />
<br />
     I am posting this just to became a template to made other items as you like.<br />
<br />
     I don't know if this method is already familiar, in this case, plz tell me and I will remove it immediately.<br />
