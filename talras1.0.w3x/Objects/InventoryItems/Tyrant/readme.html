I needed an &amp;quot;item&amp;quot; version of it so I asked him and he said I could modify/animate it :) In my map it's called the Tyrant so that's why the model here is named that. Uses internal textures (since his did too). It spins and has red glow and stars.<br />

Thank and credit him too if you're going to use this (well, he doesn't accept messages so you could leave him a note LOL)<br /><br /><b>Textures:</b><br /><ul style="margin: 0px;"><li>None</li></ul><br />Please give me credit for my work<br />Do not redistribute this model without consent!<br /><br />Model was uploaded 2010, May 3<br />Model was last updated 2010, May 9<br /><br /><br />Visit <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com">The Hive Workshop</a> for more downloads
