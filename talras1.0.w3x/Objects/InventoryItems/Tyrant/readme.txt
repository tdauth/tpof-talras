Description:
This model is initially made by Gottfrei:

I needed an &quot;item&quot; version of it so I asked him and he said I could modify/animate it :) In my map it's called the Tyrant so that's why the model here is named that. Uses internal textures (since his did too). It spins and has red glow and stars.

Thank and credit him too if you're going to use this (well, he doesn't accept messages so you could leave him a note LOL)

Textures:
None
