Leprechaun
By Gottfrei

Description:
Its one from my earlier works.
I hope you find a good use for it.

I made that strange texture, cause I'd not found any good green ones in the mpq.


Please give credits if you use it.

Update: add stand 2 and stand 3 animations.
Update2: decrease particle emmition and speed in spell - 1 animation.

Textures:
