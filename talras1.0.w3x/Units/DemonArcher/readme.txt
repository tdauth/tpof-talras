Demon Archer
By Tarrasque

Description:
Made this a couple months ago. It is currently used in Moyack's map Power of Corruption. Check it out: http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/maps-564/power-corruption-v2-3-a-162185/

Btw preview it inside world editor otherwise animations are distorted and seem wrong.

Portrait is in the same mdx file.

You can modify all my resourses whitout asking permission(not for commercial use), just give me credit for the original.
