Templar Plague-Doctor
By Direfury

Description:
Another of my Templar models; this time it's a mad Plague Doctor/Healer, out to spread the Plague. As I'd worked on this model I realized he has a very &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;ish vibe to him, so I ran with it.

Feel free to use and edit this model, so long as you credit me.
