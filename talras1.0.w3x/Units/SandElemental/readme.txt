SandElemental
By [icewolf055] and

Description:
It's a Sand Elemental Hero that the OaD group requested from me for their map.
I was promised to get terrain in return, but they wouldn't fulfill their end of the bargain. Granted, they did a little, but nowhere near what they had promised.

So I'm releasing it to the public. Because it would be a waste to just archive it.
Used a couple pieces from icewolf055's Shadow Elemental, with his permission.

And hey, it turned out quite nice in my opinion.
Uses only ingame textures, so it's easy to import. ;P

[b]Edit[/b]: Fixed an error where the lower part of the sand elemental didn't show.
Hopefully it should be fixed. If you guys come across an error or somehting again, please let me know.

[b]Edit x2[/b]: Tweaked the shading of the helmet. Hopefully, I wont have to do more tweaks. XD

[b]Edit x3[/b]: Lowered the amount of particle emitters as requested by Misha. Tweaked the helmet a little bit more.

[b]Edit x4[/b]: Death sound has been added. Went with the ObsidianAvengerDeath sound.
Tweaked the death animation so that his sand wont flip up like a cone. ;P

Textures:
None
