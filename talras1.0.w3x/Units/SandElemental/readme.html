I was promised to get terrain in return, but they wouldn't fulfill their end of the bargain. Granted, they did a little, but nowhere near what they had promised.<br />
<br />
So I'm releasing it to the public. Because it would be a waste to just archive it.<br />
Used a couple pieces from icewolf055's Shadow Elemental, with his permission.<br />
<br />
And hey, it turned out quite nice in my opinion.<br />
Uses only ingame textures, so it's easy to import. ;P<br />
<br />
<b>Edit</b>: Fixed an error where the lower part of the sand elemental didn't show.<br />
Hopefully it should be fixed. If you guys come across an error or somehting again, please let me know.<br />
<br />
<b>Edit x2</b>: Tweaked the shading of the helmet. Hopefully, I wont have to do more tweaks. XD<br />
<br />
<b>Edit x3</b>: Lowered the amount of particle emitters as requested by Misha. Tweaked the helmet a little bit more.<br />
<br />
<b>Edit x4</b>: Death sound has been added. Went with the ObsidianAvengerDeath sound.<br />
Tweaked the death animation so that his sand wont flip up like a cone. ;P<br /><br /><b>Textures:</b><br /><ul style="margin: 0px;"><li>None</li></ul><br />Please give me credit for my work<br />Do not redistribute this model without consent!<br /><br />Model was uploaded 2013, December 1<br />Model was last updated 2013, December 3<br /><br /><br />Visit <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com">The Hive Workshop</a> for more downloads
