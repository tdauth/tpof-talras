# The Power of Fire: Talras



## Setup

The map's code is based on multiple vJass code files which are part of this repository.
You have to customize the import path in the custom map script: ``
and save the map with vJass enabled.

## History

This map is based on my Warcraft III: Frozen Throne modification [The Power of Fire](https://github.com/tdauth/dmdf) which completely alterated the game and could be played as multiplayer map or singleplayer campaign.
Due to the changes from Warcraft III: Reforged I decided to publish the project as standalone multiplayer funmap.
